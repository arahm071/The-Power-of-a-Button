    "\n",
    "* **Control group** sample size: **32970**\n",
    "* **Testing group** sample size: **16543**\n",
    "\n",
    "In A/B testing, a larger sample size brings several key benefits that strengthen the reliability and interpretability of our findings. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Statistical Power and Detecting True Differences:** Larger sample sizes increase our statistical power, which is the ability to confidently detect a true difference between groups if one exists. With more data points, we reduce the risk of falsely concluding that there's no difference (false negative) when a real effect might be present. In this project, the substantial control and testing group sizes provide us with the necessary power to identify even subtle changes in customer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Representativeness and Generalizability:**  Ideally, our sample should be representative of the broader population we wish to understand (in this case, all potential grocery shoppers).  Larger sample sizes tend to better reflect the diversity and variability within the population, making it more likely that the patterns observed in our sample hold true for the wider user base.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Reliability of Estimates and Minimizing Variability:** A larger sample size reduces random variability (noise) within each group. This leads to tighter confidence intervals around our key metrics (like click-through rate).  With reliable estimates, we gain a clearer picture of the true impact of the UI change.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Informing Test Selection:** Sample size plays a key role in choosing the appropriate statistical test for analysis.  Some tests have assumptions about sample size, and a sufficiently large sample allows us to use more robust techniques, enhancing the validity of our conclusions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Projecting Impact to Population:** With a 2:1 control to testing ratio and large sample sizes, we can more confidently project the potential impact of the UI change if implemented across the entire customer base. A smaller sample could result in an inflated estimate of the effect size and misrepresent the true impact on the wider business.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In conclusion, the large sample sizes in this project enhance the validity and robustness of our results. They allow us to detect meaningful differences with confidence, generalize our findings, and make informed business decisions based on our A/B test.**"

    "While the initial CTR comparison suggests that the test group (button format) might be outperforming the control group (link format), we need a more in-depth analysis to draw meaningful conclusions. Direct CTR comparisons can be misleading for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Sample Size Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample sizes in our test and control groups are different. Sample size differences can impact the reliability of our comparison. A very high CTR with a small sample size might not be as compelling as a slightly lower CTR observed within a larger sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Statistical Testing for Significance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Directly comparing the rates gives us a starting point, but it doesn't reveal whether the observed difference is statistically significant or simply due to chance. To make definitive conclusions, we need to conduct a statistical test. These tests factor in both the CTRs and the sample sizes of each group, determining if the difference we see is likely due to the UI change or if it could have occurred by random variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Limitations of CTR**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the CTR is higher in the test group, this metric alone provides limited insights. CTR only captures clicks, but what happens after the click? We need to consider whether users are engaging with the content after clicking or quickly bouncing back. Focusing solely on CTR doesn't provide this nuanced view of user behavior.\n",

    "Click-through rates offer a valuable starting point in A/B testing analysis. However, to make informed decisions and ensure the observed differences are not due to chance or other factors, we need to use statistical testing. This next phase will determine the statistical significance of the CTR difference, providing a robust foundation for conclusions about the impact of our UI change. \n"

    "Before applying a specific statistical test to our A/B testing data, it's crucial to verify that the data meets the underlying **assumptions** of the test. This ensures the **validity** and **reliability** of our results.  Here's a breakdown of the key assumption checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Checking for Normality**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why it matters:** Many statistical tests, particularly **parametric tests**, assume that the data follows a **normal distribution** (bell-shaped curve).\n",
    "* **Test example:** **Shapiro-Wilk test** is a common test used to assess normality.\n",
    "* **Outcome:**\n",
    "    * If the data is **normally distributed** (passes the Shapiro-Wilk test), we can proceed with parametric tests (e.g., **t-test**) which are generally more powerful.\n",
    "    * If the data is not normally distributed (fails the Shapiro-Wilk test), we should consider **non-parametric tests** which are less reliant on specific data distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Homogeneity of Variance**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it means:** This refers to the assumption that the **variances** (spread) of the data in each group (control and test) are approximately equal.\n",
    "* **Why it matters:** Unequal variances can affect the validity of certain parametric tests.\n",
    "* **Test example:** **Levene's test** is commonly used to assess homogeneity of variance.\n",
    "* **Outcome:**\n",
    "    * If the variances are equal (passes Levene's test), we can proceed with the chosen parametric test (e.g., t-test).\n",
    "    * If the variances are unequal (fails Levene's test), we can still use a parametric test, but we need to adjust it to account for the unequal variances (e.g., **Welch's t-test**). Alternatively, we can choose a non-parametric test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing the Right Test:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision of which test to use (parametric or non-parametric) ultimately depends on the outcome of the assumption checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **If the data is normally distributed and has equal variances:** A parametric test (e.g., t-test) is generally preferred due to its increased power.\n",
    "* **If the data is not normally distributed or has unequal variances:** A non-parametric test (e.g., **Mann-Whitney U test**) is a more suitable choice.\n",

    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Shapiro-Wilk test compares the sample data to a theoretically perfect **normal distribution**. It calculates a test statistic called **W**, which measures how closely the sample data matches the expected values of a normal distribution. \n",

    "**Hypothesis Testing**\n",

    "* **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** Our data *significantly deviates* from a normal distribution (p-value ≤ 0.05) \n",

While the Mann-Whitney U test typically compares the **medians** of two independent groups, when dealing with **binary data** (like clicks vs. no clicks in our case), the interpretation is slightly different. Here, the test assesses whether the distributions of **0s (no clicks)** and **1s (clicks)** differ significantly between the control and test groups. \n",

    "2. **Handling Ties:** If multiple observations have the same value (ties), they receive the average rank of the positions they would occupy if there were no ties. With binary data, ties are common (all the 0s or all the 1s) and this averaging ensures a fair ranking.\n",
    "3. **Rank Sums:** The ranks of observations within each group (control and test) are summed up separately.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The distribution of **binary outcomes (clicks)** is the same for both groups (p-value > 0.05). In our case, this would mean the UI change (button vs. link) had no impact on signup rates (clicks).\n",
